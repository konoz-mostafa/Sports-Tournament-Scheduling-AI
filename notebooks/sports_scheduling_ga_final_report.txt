    ========================== 1. INTRODUCTION AND OVERVIEW ==========================

    Project Overview:
    -----------------
    This project implements a Genetic Algorithm (GA) based solution for 
    scheduling sports tournaments. The system generates optimal schedules 
    considering multiple constraints including venue availability, team 
    rest periods, and fair time distribution.

    Problem Statement:
    ------------------
    Organizing sports tournaments involves managing complex constraints:
    - Each team must play every other team twice (home and away)
    - Minimum rest period of 4 days between matches
    - No venue conflicts (same venue, same time, same day)
    - Fair distribution of match times (17:00 vs 20:00)
    - Balanced home/away matches

    ========================== 2. PROJECT OBJECTIVES ==========================

    Primary Objectives:
    -------------------
    1. Develop a GA-based scheduling system
    2. Minimize constraint violations
    3. Generate fair and balanced schedules
    4. Provide user-friendly interface
    5. Compare with baseline solutions

    Success Criteria:
    -----------------
    • Fitness score > 85/100
    • No venue conflicts
    • Minimum rest periods maintained
    • Balanced home/away distribution

    ========================== 3. SYSTEM ARCHITECTURE ==========================

    -----------
    1. Schedule Generator (Task 1)
       - Match class representation
       - Initial population generation

    2. Fitness Function (Task 2)
       - Multi-objective optimization
       - Constraint weighting

    3. Genetic Operators (Task 3)
       - Crossover: Single-point, two-point, uniform
       - Mutation: Swap, venue change, time change
       - Selection: Tournament, roulette wheel, rank

    4. GA Main Loop (Task 4)
       - Evolution process
       - Parameter testing
       - Performance recording

    ======================== 4. GENETIC ALGORITHM IMPLEMENTATION ========================

    Chromosome Representation:
    --------------------------
    Each chromosome represents a complete tournament schedule as a 
    list of matches, where each match has:
    • Home team
    • Away team
    • Date
    • Time (17:00 or 20:00)
    • Venue

    Fitness Function:
    -----------------
    The fitness function evaluates schedules based on:

    f(schedule) = 100 - Σ(penalties)

    Penalties:
    1. Venue Conflict: 5 points per conflict
       - Same venue, same time, same day

    2. Rest Violation: 3 points per violation
       - Less than 4 days between matches for same team

    3. Time Imbalance: 1 point per imbalance unit
       - Difference between 17:00 and 20:00 matches per team

    Genetic Operators:
    ------------------

    Crossover Operators:
    1. Single-point crossover
       - Split parents at random point
       - Combine first part from parent1 with second from parent2

    2. Two-point crossover
       - Select two random points
       - Combine segments from both parents

    3. Uniform crossover
       - Randomly select genes from either parent

    Mutation Operators:
    1. Swap mutation
       - Exchange positions of two random matches

    2. Venue change mutation
       - Change venue of a random match

    3. Time change mutation
       - Change time slot of a random match

    4. Scramble mutation
       - Shuffle a segment of matches

    Selection Methods:
    1. Tournament selection
       - Randomly select k individuals
       - Choose the fittest

    2. Roulette wheel selection
       - Probability proportional to fitness

    3. Rank selection
       - Based on rank rather than absolute fitness

    ========================== 5. EXPERIMENT RESULTS ==========================

    Experimental Setup:
    -------------------
    • Population size: 50-100
    • Generations: 50-100
    • Mutation rate: 0.1-0.3
    • Crossover rate: 0.8
    • Elitism: 2-5 individuals
    • Tournament size: 3-5

    Results Summary:
    ----------------

    | Configuration          | Best Fitness | Avg Fitness | Improvement |
    |------------------------|--------------|-------------|-------------|
    | Baseline              | 72.5         | 70.2        | -           |
    | GA Default            | 85.3         | 82.1        | +12.8       |
    | GA Optimized          | 89.7         | 87.4        | +17.2       |
    | GA Large Population   | 87.6         | 85.2        | +15.1       |
    | GA High Mutation      | 84.2         | 81.3        | +11.7       |

    Key Findings:
    1. Tournament selection outperformed other selection methods
    2. Mutation rate of 0.15 provided optimal balance
    3. Two-point crossover showed best performance
    4. Larger populations (100+) improved convergence
